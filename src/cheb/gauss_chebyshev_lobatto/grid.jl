"""
The `GaussChebyshevLobattoGrid` module provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with Chebyshev points of the 2nd kind
and coefficients of the corresponding 1st-kind Chebyshev series expansion.

The module is designed to work with the standard interval [-1,1] by default, but also supports
mapped intervals [a,b] through appropriate scaling transformations.
