    cheb_series_chop(coeffs::AbstractVector{TF}, tol::TF = eps(TF)) where {TF<:AbstractFloat}

Determine a suitable cutoff index for a coefficient vector using the "standard" chopping rule [aurentz2015choppingchebyshevseries](@cite).

# Arguments
- `coeffs::AbstractVector{TF}`: A non-empty vector of coefficients (real or complex).
- `tol::TF`: A target relative accuracy, a number in `(0, 1)`. Defaults to machine epsilon (`eps(Float64)`).

# Returns
- `cutoff::Int`: A positive integer representing the chopping point.
    - If `cutoff == length(coeffs)`, a satisfactory chopping point was not found (the algorithm is "not happy").
    - If `cutoff < length(coeffs)`, this is the recommended last index to keep (the algorithm is "happy").

# Examples
```julia
coeffs = 10.0 .^ -(1:50)
random = cos.((1.0:50.0).^2)
println("Example 1: ", cheb_series_chop(coeffs)) # Should be 18
println("Example 2: ", cheb_series_chop(coeffs .+ 1e-16 .* random)) # Should be 15
println("Example 3: ", cheb_series_chop(coeffs .+ 1e-13 .* random)) # Should be 13
println("Example 4: ", cheb_series_chop(coeffs .+ 1e-10 .* random)) # Should be 50
println("Example 5: ", cheb_series_chop(coeffs .+ 1e-10 .* random, 1e-10)) # Should be 10
```
