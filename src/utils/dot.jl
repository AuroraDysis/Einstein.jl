    dot_xsum(x::StridedVector{T}, y::StridedVector{T}) where {T<:Real}

Compute the dot product of two vectors using extended precision accumulation.
Uses the `xsum` package for improved numerical accuracy.

# Note
- Very fast for large vectors, but a bit slower than Kahan summation for small vectors.
- Both input vectors must have the same length, which is not checked for performance reasons.

    dot_kahan(v1::StridedVector{T}, v2::StridedVector{T}) where {T<:Number}

Neumaier's variant of Kahan summation algorithm to reduce numerical errors.

# Note
- Slower than `dot_xsum` for large vectors, but faster for small vectors.
- Similar performance to `dot_kahan`
- Uses loop unrolling for better performance while maintaining Kahan summation's
numerical stability. Processes two elements per iteration when possible.
