  abstract = {The classical techniques for determining weights in finite difference formulas were either computationally slow or very limited in their scope (e.g., specialized recursions for centered and staggered approximations, for Adams--Bashforth-, Adams--Moulton-, and BDF-formulas for ODEs, etc.). Two recent algorithms overcome these problems. For equispaced grids, such weights can be found very conveniently with a two-line algorithm when using a symbolic language such as Mathematica (reducing to one line in the case of explicit approximations). For arbitrarily spaced grids, we describe a computationally very inexpensive numerical algorithm.}

A straightforward implementation of these methods involves the use of spectral differentiation matrices. To obtain optimal accuracy these matrices must be computed carefully. We demonstrate that naive algorithms for computing these matrices suffer from severe loss of accuracy due to roundoff errors. Several improvements are analyzed and compared. A number of numerical examples are provided, demonstrating significant differences between the sensitivity of the forward problem and the inverse problem.}
